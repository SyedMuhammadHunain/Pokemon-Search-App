# Pokemon-Search-App freeCodeCamp Ceertified Project
* This Pokémon Search App allows users to search for Pokémon by their name or ID.
* It fetches data from the Pokémon API and displays its Stats (Name, HP, Attack, Type, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed).
* The interesting part is that it also shows the Image of the Pokemon which is fetched from the Pokemon API.
